1) yes it does.
2)
1. For c=100: the hyperplane will likely have a narrower margin compared to the one obtained with C=0.01
2. For c=300: The hyperplane will likely have an even narrower margin compared to C=100, leading to a more aggressive classification of data points.
3. For c=700: The resulting hyperplane is expected to have an even narrower margin compared to C=300, leading to a more aggressive separation of classes.
4.For c=1000: The hyperplane will likely have an extremely narrow margin, resulting in a very aggressive classification of data points.
