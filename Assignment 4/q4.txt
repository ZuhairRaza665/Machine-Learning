The optimal parameters found by GridSearchCV are C=100 and gamma=0.01. With these parameters, the estimated cross-validated accuracy is approximately 95.19%. When evaluating the model on the test set, it achieves an accuracy of 100%, indicating that the model generalizes well to unseen data. This suggests that the Gaussian kernel SVM with the selected parameters performs very well on this dataset, achieving perfect accuracy on the test set.
