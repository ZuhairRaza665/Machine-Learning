1) Accuracy with Polynomial Kernel: 0.8333333333333334
Accuracy with Gaussian Kernel: 0.9
 Gaussian kernel performed slightly better than the polynomial kernel
2) 
	•	When C=0.1:
	•	Degree=1: Accuracy is 0.733
	•	Degree=2: Accuracy is 0.9
	•	Degree=3: Accuracy is 0.833
	•	When C=1:
	•	Degree=1: Accuracy is 0.9
	•	Degree=2: Accuracy is 0.833
	•	Degree=3: Accuracy is 0.833
	•	When C=10:
	•	Degree=1: Accuracy is 0.9
	•	Degree=2: Accuracy is 0.9
	•	Degree=3: Accuracy is 0.8

From these results, we can observe that:
	•	Higher values of C tend to perform better overall.
	•	Degree=2 seems to perform consistently well across different values of C.
	•	While increasing the degree beyond 2 doesn't consistently improve performance and may lead to overfitting.

3) 
	•	When C=0.1:
	•	Sigma=0.1: Accuracy is 0.3
	•	Sigma=1: Accuracy is 0.833
	•	Sigma=10: Accuracy is 0.3
	•	When C=1:
	•	Sigma=0.1: Accuracy is 0.833
	•	Sigma=1: Accuracy is 0.9
	•	Sigma=10: Accuracy is 0.3
	•	When C=10:
	•	Sigma=0.1: Accuracy is 0.667
	•	Sigma=1: Accuracy is 0.9
	•	Sigma=10: Accuracy is 0.9
From these results, we can observe that:
	•	Higher values of C generally lead to better performance.
	•	The choice of sigma, with sigma=1 generally performing well across different values of C.
	•	Extreme values of sigma, such as 0.1 and 10, lead to poorer performance.
